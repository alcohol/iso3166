## Contributing to league/iso3166

Fork the [project](https://github.com/thephpleague/iso3166), create a feature branch, and send a pull request.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows the [PSR-2 Coding Standards](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). You can also run [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) with the configuration file that can be found in the project root directory.

If you would like to help, take a look at the [list of open issues](https://github.com/thephpleague/iso3166/issues).
